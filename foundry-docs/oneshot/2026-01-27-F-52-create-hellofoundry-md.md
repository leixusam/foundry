**Status**: Complete

## What Was Done

Created `hellofoundry.md` file in the project root with text content extracted from two images attached to the Linear ticket:
1. An "Executive Summary" section containing analysis of 631 Intercom conversations about onboarding and payroll issues
2. A "DataFrames Created" section listing 7 data frames with their row counts and descriptions

## Files Changed

- `hellofoundry.md` - Created new file with parsed text content from ticket images

## Verification

## Notes

The task involved reading two PNG images from the Linear ticket attachments (downloaded to `.foundry/attachments/F-52/`) and extracting the text content to create a markdown file. The images contained:
1. An executive summary about customer issues with onboarding and payroll systems
2. A list of pandas DataFrames created for data analysis
