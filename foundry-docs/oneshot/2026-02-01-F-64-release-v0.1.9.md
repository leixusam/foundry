# Oneshot: Release v0.1.9 to GitHub and npm

**Issue**: F-64
**Date**: 2026-02-01
**Status**: Complete

## What Was Done

Released version 0.1.9 of @leixusam/foundry:
1. Bumped version from 0.1.8 to 0.1.9 using `npm version patch`
2. Pushed the version commit and tag to GitHub
3. Created GitHub release which triggered automatic npm publish via CI/CD

## Commands Executed

```bash
npm version patch                                    # v0.1.9
git push origin main && git push origin --tags       # Push version bump and tag
gh release create v0.1.9 --generate-notes --title "v0.1.9"  # Create release
```

## Files Changed

- `package.json` - version: 0.1.8 → 0.1.9

## CI/CD Pipeline

The existing CI/CD pipeline handles npm publishing automatically:
- `.github/workflows/publish.yml` - Triggers on GitHub release creation
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Runs build/typecheck on pushes

## Verification

- GitHub Release: https://github.com/leixusam/foundry/releases/tag/v0.1.9
- CI Build: PASS (completed successfully)
- Publish Workflow: Triggered and running

## Notes

- The release process was already fully documented in CLAUDE.md
- npm publishing is automated via GitHub Actions - no manual intervention needed
- The NPM_TOKEN secret must be configured in GitHub repository settings for the publish workflow to succeed
