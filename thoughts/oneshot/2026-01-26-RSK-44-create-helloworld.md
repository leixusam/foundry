# Oneshot: Create a new file called helloworld

**Issue**: RSK-44
**Date**: 2026-01-26
**Status**: Complete

## What Was Done

Created a simple markdown file called `helloworld.md` at the project root. The issue description was empty, so a minimal markdown file was created following the pattern of similar previous tickets (RSK-6, RSK-7).

## Files Changed

- `helloworld.md` - New file created with a simple "Hello World" heading and reference to the issue.

## Verification

- Tests: N/A (no test script configured)
- TypeScript: PASS
- Lint: N/A (no lint script configured)

## Notes

This was a simple file creation task with no specific requirements for content or file type. Chose markdown format for consistency with similar previous tasks.
